# FISTBUMP - a 360 performance review 

It happens that traditional performance review are often one-sided and biased, as they relied solely on the perscpective of the manager or supervisor. 

Our goal was to develop a solution that would provide a more comprehensive and balanced assessment of employee performance. We wanted to create a platform that would facilitate a 360-degree review process, allowing employees to receive feedback from not only their managers but also their peers, subordinates, and even themselves.

To achieve this, we embarked on the development of a web application designed specifically for conducting 360-degree reviews. Our proficient team of developers and a UX designer worked collaboratively to create a user-friendly interface that would make it easy for users to request and provide feedback. We implemented features such as anonymity controls to ensure honest and constructive feedback, and we incorporated a robust reporting system to help employees track their progress over time.
